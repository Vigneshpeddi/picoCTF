# picoCTF
Hi my name is Vignesh Peddi.

I started this repository when I was still in 9th grade and still getting into CTFs. My first writeups will be from picoCTF year-round challenges. I used these challenges to get better at CTFs.

My writeups will probably not be the best at first, but I aspire to get better.

I wish anyone else in the CTF journey well!
